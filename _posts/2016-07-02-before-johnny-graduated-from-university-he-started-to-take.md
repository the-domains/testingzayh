Before Johnny graduated from university, he started to take on projects during his free time outside of lectures and tutorials. He spent most of his evenings coordinating meetings with brand executives and handbag designers. Johnny frequently found it frustrating, to have to search for sales and simultaneously work on his designs. He constantly encountered creative blocks and this did not sit well with him. 

As fate would have it, he met Sarah; a fashion merchandiser that was sales savvy, during a product launch. The two of them were able to work hand in hand. As Johnny focused on his designs, Sarah sourced for materials and looked for sales. Soon after they managed to grow their teamwork into a startup.

They hired, marketing assistants and web designers. Their countless brainstorming as a team led to them, reflecting on past problems they encountered. 

They devised a system that would assist all novice,junior and freelance designers, and take away the problems that they themselves encountered first hand. This system would handle marketing, sales, website design, website coding, and payment. Allowing the designers to focus on what they do best. 

Their concept: ZAYH has worked well enough, for it to transition to other industries which include: Technology, design, gaming, video production. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/215b4f16-0653-415a-a104-17bdd204bc3e.jpg)
